This introductory artificial intelligence course at UC Berkeley provides in-depth and accessible course notes, making it possible to grasp the material without necessarily watching the lecture videos. The course follows the chapters of the classic AI textbook *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*, covering topics such as search pruning, constraint satisfaction problems, Markov decision processes, reinforcement learning, Bayesian networks, Hidden Markov Models, as well as fundamental concepts in machine learning and neural networks.

The Fall 2018 version of the course offered free access to gradescope, allowing students to complete written assignments online and receive real-time assessment results. The course also includes 6 projects of high quality, featuring the recreation of the classic Pac-Man game. These projects challenge students to apply their AI knowledge to implement various algorithms, enabling their Pac-Man to navigate mazes, evade ghosts, and collect pellets.
