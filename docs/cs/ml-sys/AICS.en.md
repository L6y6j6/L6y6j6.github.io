Intelligent computing systems serve as the backbone for global AI, producing billions of devices annually, including smartphones, servers, and wearables. Training professionals for these systems is critical for China's AI industry competitiveness. Understanding intelligent computing systems is vital for computer science students, shaping their core skills.

Prof. Yunji Chen's course, taught in various universities, uses experiments to provide a holistic view of the AI tech stack. Covering deep learning frameworks, coding in low-level languages, and hardware design, the course fosters a systematic approach.

Personally, completing experiments 2-5 enhanced my grasp of deep learning frameworks. The BCL language experiment in chapter five is reminiscent of CUDA for those familiar.

I recommend the textbook for a comprehensive tech stack understanding. Deep learning-savvy students can start from chapter five to delve into deep learning framework internals.

Inspired by the course, I developed a [simple deep learning framework](https://github.com/ysj1173886760/PyToy) and plan a tutorial. Written in Python, it's code-light, suitable for students with some foundation. Future plans include more operators and potential porting to C++ for balanced performance and efficiency.

## Personal Resources

### New Edition Experiments for 2024

- The 2024 edition of the Intelligent Computing Systems lab has undergone extensive adjustments in the knowledge structure, experimental topics, and lab manuals, including comprehensive use of PyTorch instead of TensorFlow, and the addition of experiments related to large models.
- As the new lab topics and manuals have not been updated on the Cambricon Forum, the following repository is provided to store the new versions of the Intelligent Computing Systems lab topics, manuals, and individual experiment answers:
- The resources for the new edition will be updated following the course schedule of the UCAS Spring Semester 2024, with completion expected by June 2024.
- 2024 New labs, manuals, and answers created by @Yuichi: https://github.com/Yuichi1001/2024-AICS-EXP

### Old Edition Experiments

- Old edition coursework: 6 experiments (including writing convolution operators, adding operators to TensorFlow, writing operators with BCL and integrating them into TensorFlow, etc.) (details can be found on the official website)
- Old edition lab manuals: [Experiment 2.0 Instruction Manual](https://forum.cambricon.com/index.php?m=content&c=index&a=show&catid=155&id=708)
- Learning notes: https://sanzo.top/categories/AI-Computing-Systems/, notes summarized from the lab manuals (link is no longer active)
- @ysj1173886760 has compiled all resources and homework implementations used in this course at [ysj1173886760/Learning: ai-system - GitHub](https://github.com/ysj1173886760/Learning/tree/master/ai-system).
