Official Description:

This introductory course in computer graphics begins with using Blender to generate images and understanding the underlying mathematical concepts, including triangles, normals, interpolation, texture mapping, bump mapping, and more. It then delves into light and color and how they affect computer displays and printing. The course also covers BRDF and some basic lighting and shading models. Towards the end, topics like ray tracing, anti-aliasing, and acceleration structures are introduced.

This course is somewhat less in-depth compared to GAMES101 and uses Python, making it more accessible for students who are not familiar with C++.
