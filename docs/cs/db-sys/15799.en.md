# CMU 15-799: Special Topics in Database Systems

## Course Introduction

- **University**: Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)
- **Prerequisites**: CMU 15-445

- **Course Difficulty**: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
- **Estimated Study Time**: 80 hours

This course has only been offered twice so far, in Fall 2013 and Spring 2022, and it discusses some cutting-edge topics in the field of databases. The Fall 2013 session covered topics like Streaming, Graph DB, NVM, etc., while the Spring 2022 session mainly focused on Self-Driving DBMS, with relevant papers provided.

The tasks for the Spring 2022 version of the course included:

1. **Task One**: Manual performance tuning based on `PostgreSQL`.
2. **Task Two**: Improving the Self-Driving DBMS based on [NoisePage Pilot](https://github.com/cmu-db/noisepage-pilot), with no limitations on features.

The teaching style is more akin to a seminar, with fewer programming assignments. This course can broaden the horizons for general students and may be particularly beneficial for those specializing in databases.
