# Docker

## Why Docker

The main obstacle when using software/tools developed by others is often the hassle of setting up the environment. This configuration headache can significantly dampen your enthusiasm for software and programming. While virtual machines can solve some of these issues, they are cumbersome and might not be worth simulating an entire operating system for a single application's configuration.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) has changed the game by making environment configuration (potentially) less painful. In essence, Docker uses lightweight "containers" instead of an entire operating system to support an application's configuration. Applications, along with their environment configurations, are packaged into images that can freely run on different platforms in containers, saving considerable time and effort for everyone.

## How to learn Docker

The [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) is the best starting point, but the best teacher is often yourselfâ€”try using Docker to experience its convenience. Docker has rapidly developed in the industry and is already quite mature. You can download its desktop version and use the graphical interface.

If you're like me, reinventing the wheel, consider building a [Mini Docker](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/rubber-docker) yourself to deepen your understanding.

[KodeKloud Docker for the Absolute Beginner](https://kodekloud.com/courses/docker-for-the-absolute-beginner/) offers a comprehensive introduction to Docker's basic functionalities with numerous hands-on exercises. It also provides a free cloud environment for practice. While other cloud-related courses, such as Kubernetes, may require payment, I highly recommend them. The explanations are detailed, suitable for beginners, and come with a corresponding Kubernetes lab environment, eliminating the need for complex setups.
