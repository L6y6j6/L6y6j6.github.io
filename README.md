This is a **very rough** [online public notebook üìù](https://l6y6j6.github.io/mydocs/), mainly used to record and back up things learned daily.

This notebook is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and uses the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. The Chinese font is [LXGW WenKai Screen](https://github.com/lxgw/LxgwWenKai-Screen), and the English font is [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).
